# Programming Exercises (Write Pseudocode first)

# Design a program that displays the following information:
# Your name
# Your address (include city, state and postcode)
# Your telephone number
# Your future job (name would like to become an astronaut.)

# Pseudocode:
# Personal-Information-Card:
#    DISPLAY "Name = Lucas"
#    DISPLAY "Address = The Nguyen Residence"
#    DISPLAY "Telephone Number = +61 490 753 828"
#    DISPLAY "Nobel Prize Winner"
# END

# print("Name = Lucas")
# print("Address = The Nguyen Residence")
# print("Telephone Number = +61 490 753 828")
# print("Nobel Prize Winner")

# Sales Prediction
# A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales.
# Design a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales and then displays
# the profit that will be made from that amount.
# Hint: Use 0.23 to represent 23 percent

# Pseudocode:
# Sales Prediction:
#     DECLARE ts
#     ts = INPUT companies total sales
#     DISPLAY "Your annual profit was {ts*0.23}"
# END
#
# ts = int(input("What was the companies total sales: "))
# print(f"Your annual profit was {ts*0.23}")

# DISPLAY "Enter the length of the room."
# INPUT length
# DECLARE Integer length
# print("Enter the length of the room.")
# input("")
# length = "unused variable"

# DECLARE Integer length
# DISPLAY "Enter the length of the room."
# INPUT length
# length = input("Enter the length of the room: ")
# print(length)
